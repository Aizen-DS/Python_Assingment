Task 1 — Reading a File

In this part, the program tries to open a file named sample.txt in read mode.

It reads the file line by line.

Each line is printed along with its line number.

If the file doesn’t exist, the program doesn’t crash — instead, it shows an error message saying the file was not found.


Task 2 — Writing and Appending Data to a File

In this part, the program:

Takes input from the user and writes it into a file called output.txt (this creates the file if it doesn’t already exist).

Takes another input from the user and appends it to the same file without deleting the previous data.

Finally, it reads and displays all the content inside output.txt after writing and appending.
